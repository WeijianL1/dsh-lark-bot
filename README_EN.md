## Overview

Make DeepSeek Harness a member of your Feishu/Lark and drive your local coding agent directly from phone, group, or thread. It uses a Feishu WebSocket long connection, so you need **no public IP, domain, server, or NAT-tunnelling**; Linux / macOS / Windows, Node.js ≥ 22.

---

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is installed with `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` configured; Node.js ≥ 22.19; a Feishu / Lark account.

```bash
npx dsh-lark-bot@latest setup --profile dsh-lark   # ① one-command install (into a dsh profile + safety-net guardian by default)
dsh --profile dsh-lark                              # ② start
```

③ On first start the terminal prints a QR code → scan it with the Feishu app to create / select a PersonalAgent
app → once bound, message the bot directly; groups / threads default to `@bot`.

- **Already have an app**: skip the scan with `DSH_LARK_APP_ID=cli_xxx DSH_LARK_APP_SECRET=<secret> DSH_LARK_TENANT=feishu dsh --profile dsh-lark`.
- **Upgrade**: `npx dsh-lark-bot@latest upgrade --profile dsh-lark --yes`.

> **No terminal needed**: an admin just sends `/upgrade` in Feishu.

---

## Core capabilities

**Unique to the ecosystem**

- **Safety-net guardian**: Feishu still replies if dsh crashes; `/safemode` opens a core-only safe mode to self-heal, queued tasks are restored on restart, and `/jobs` retries explicitly. Most bridges are "serial single chat + lost on crash".
- **Multi-bot trusted hand-off**: `bot add` adds independent instances and trusted bots hand off with a real @ in the same group, capped.
- **Full workspace & session management**: an isolated git worktree is auto-created per session; `/session` lists / binds sessions and `/archive` + `/retention` auto-archive and clean up, so the session list never gets cluttered.
- **Robust version management**: an admin just sends `/upgrade` in Feishu to update, verify, and reload in the background; you're only nudged when a new version exists, with no interruption to current work.
- **dsh Web visual settings**: point-and-click work dir, model, concurrency, and reminders in Settings → Plugins — no env vars to memorize.

**Other core capabilities**

- **Parallel tasks**: many tasks run concurrently in the same group with isolated sessions.
- **Multi-role agents**: `/role` switches / assigns PM, dev, doc, etc., each with its own persona, model preference, and rules.
- **In-chat model & key management**: one `/config` card to switch providers and hot-reload keys, without leaving Feishu.
- **Quick / balanced / deep mode**: `/mode` picks the strength for the next turn without interrupting the current task.
- **Plan gate for key tasks**: `lark_request_plan_approval` sends the full plan first, then approves or revises.
- **Cross-session notify + @**: a task finishing in group A can push to group B / DM and @ you.
- **Forward notifications to other IMs (notification-only)**: after `/channels` is configured, completion / failure / approval and urgent/fault notifications can be pushed one-way to Telegram / WeCom group robots and more. Push-only, no inbound interaction; Feishu stays the sole full-interaction platform and the default behavior is unchanged when no channel is configured. **`/channels add --qr <wechat|qq|telegram>` shows a QR code image in the Feishu session — scanning it with the matching IM app creates and binds the notification channel.**

> Streaming process cards render in a native Feishu collapsible panel.

## Command reference

Command help, status, and cards are bilingual; `/help` is the full authoritative list. All commands are in [`docs/MANUAL.md`](docs/MANUAL.md).

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/config` | Model / provider / credential management card (`/model`, `/provider(s)`, `/key` are aliases of the same card) |
| `/new` `/reset` | Start a new session |
| `/status` | Status card (workspace / model / session / run / token / job ledger) |
| `/mode` (`/effort`) | Pick quick / balanced / deep strength |
| `/cd <path>` | Switch to an independent session in that directory |
| `/ws list\|save\|use\|remove` | Manage named workspaces |
| `/jobs [list\|show\|retry]` | Reconcile and retry queued/running/failed/interrupted jobs |
| `/session`、`/session bind` | Browse / explicitly bind a DSH session |
| `/role list\|show\|set\|clear` | View / bind roles |
| `/notify <scope\|chatId> <text>` | Cross-session notification (admin) |
| `/notifications [show\|off\|on …]` | Configure completion / failure / approval / urgent reminders (`sinks=` forwards to other IM channels) |
| `/channels [list\|show\|add\|accept\|remove\|enable\|disable …]` | Manage outbound notification channels (admin); `add --qr <wechat\|qq\|telegram>` is scan-to-bind |
| `/stop` | Stop current tasks |
| `/upgrade` | Self-update (admin) |
| `/doctor` | Generate a redacted diagnostic bundle (admin) |
| `/help` | Show the command list |

> **⚠️ Official channels only**: the only official repo is [PlutoKeating/dsh-lark-bot](https://github.com/PlutoKeating/dsh-lark-bot),

> **never ships a Windows .exe or a "download & run" installer** — any page or repo distributing one under its name
> is **fake / malicious**. The only official install command is `npx dsh-lark-bot@latest setup --profile dsh-lark`.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I connect DeepSeek Harness to Feishu?**
**A:** With Node ≥ 22 and dsh installed (and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` set), run `npx dsh-lark-bot@latest setup --profile dsh-lark`, then `dsh --profile dsh-lark` and scan the QR code. DM the bot directly; groups / threads default to `@bot`.

**Q: Do I need a public IP, domain, or server?**
**A:** No. Feishu uses a WebSocket long connection (outbound), so it works behind NAT — no public server, domain, or NAT-tunnelling.

**Q: How is this different from other DeepSeek Harness Feishu plugins?**
**A:** The most complete feature set: safety-net guardian, parallel tasks, multi-role agents, multi-bot hand-off, persistent job ledger, session archive, cross-session notify, dsh Web visual settings, in-chat model & key management, execution modes, plan gate, and in-Feishu self-update. It's a standard dsh profile bundle and `setup` is the only install path.

**Q: Could there be a fake version?**
**A:** The only official repo / npm packages are above under "Official channels only"; this project never ships an `.exe` or a "download & run" installer — anything distributing an exe is fake.

## Compatibility

- **DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`)**: verified against **0.1.0-rc.8** (2026-08-25) via the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sdk-client` / `dsh-acp`; locked versions & upgrade policy in [`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).
- **Runtime**: Node.js ≥ 22.19; **Platforms**: Linux / macOS / Windows. Default adapter `sdk` (native resume / streaming / image blocks); switchable to `acp` / `headless` / `web`.

## Configuration

- **Recommended**: local dsh Web → **Settings → Plugins → dsh-lark-bot** to view / edit service region, App ID, App Secret, work dir, default model, concurrency, adapter, and reminders; App Secret is write-only.
- Or use `/config`, `/providers`, `/provider`, `/key` in Feishu to inspect / write providers, models, and credentials (admin-only).
- Env vars use the `DSH_LARK_*` prefix; state root is `~/.dsh-lark`; template in [`.env.example`](.env.example); full env-var matrix in [`docs/MANUAL.md`](docs/MANUAL.md) §9.

> Behavior details (crash reconciliation, session isolation, plan gate, per-tool approval, multi-bot hand-off, safety-net guardian) are in [`docs/FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md);
> permissions & data in [`docs/MANUAL.md`](docs/MANUAL.md) §6 and [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Security & licensing

- **License**: GNU AGPL-3.0 (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). Open source and self-hostable, free for personal / internal use; **commercial / SaaS / closed-source reuse needs a separate license**.
- **Security**: default-deny, secret redaction, path containment, SSRF protection, stale-event rejection, interaction tools disabled by default — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md); report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisory.

## Upgrade & uninstall

```bash
npx dsh-lark-bot@latest upgrade --profile dsh-lark --yes   # upgrade (or admin /upgrade in Feishu)
```

- **Disable**: export `DSH_LARK_DISABLED=1` before starting the profile (plugin stays loaded, bridge engine stops).
- **Uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile dsh-lark remove dsh-lark-bot`; local state (config / sessions / archives / roles) stays in `~/.dsh-lark`.

Use this skill when the current channel context says \`channel: dsh-lark-bot\`, or when the user asks you to install, deploy, upgrade, diagnose, or configure this Feishu/Lark channel.

Before any change, read the current effective configuration and installed versions. Never copy example values into settings. Prefer existing dsh-lark-bot commands, dsh's official settings/credentials protocol, and registered channel tools. Re-read status after a change and explain whether it applies on the next request, new session, reconnect, or service restart.

For provider/model/settings work: inspect with \`/config\` (the model/provider/credential card; \`/model\`, \`/provider(s)\`, \`/key\` are aliases of the same card), \`/status\`, or dsh settings first. Support query, add, update, remove, reset-to-default, and verification. Administrator-only writes, permission policy, workspace containment, and file policy follow the effective configuration. ${process.env.DSH_LARK_PLAN_GATE === 'off' ? "Plan approval is disabled; do not request redundant approval for authorized work." : "Plan approval remains required."}

For any API key, provider credential, token, or App Secret value, never ask the user to paste it into ordinary chat and never invent a file path or configuration key. Call \`lark_request_secret\` with only a supported target type, a validated reference name, and a short purpose. The tool result intentionally contains only configured state—not the value. The value crosses Feishu/Lark's form transport to the local bridge but must never enter the model prompt, transcript, jobs, archive, logs, diagnostic bundle, or response.

Language policy has three distinct layers: Card UI is per-viewer; plain fallback is bilingual/Chinese/English; agent final answers are auto/Chinese/English. Use \`/language\` to inspect it and require an administrator for global changes.

Guardian/safe mode is a degraded recovery surface and cannot claim full channel configuration or secure-secret tooling unless the live context explicitly advertises it.

## Operational surfaces

- Installation and lifecycle: \`setup\`, \`upgrade\`, \`doctor\`, \`service install|start|status|logs|restart|stop|uninstall\`, and \`guardian install|status|logs|restart|stop|uninstall\`.
- Configuration: dsh Web settings for common bridge fields; official \`settings.yaml\` for providers/models/default route; owner-only \`.credentials.yaml\` through the secure secret seam for values.
- Sessions/workspaces: /new, /cd, /ws, /session, /resume, /retention, /archive, /timeout, /concurrency, /stop.
- Policy/collaboration: /permission, /isolation, /role, /invite, /notify, /notifications, /replies.
